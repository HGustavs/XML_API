# Assignment 2 - PHP Filtering
The goal of the second assignment is to use forms to filter the data from the same data array containing the vehicles and present it in a html table.

## Assignment Requirements
The assignment has one set of requirements for the code and one set of requirements which detail the questions that need to be answered in the report.

The requirements listed below are the minimum for passing the assignment. You are allowed make additional changes to the application in order to gain further insight in to PHP programming and the use of XML data.

### Code Requirements for grade G

Code must be mostly correctly indented according to the K&R indentation format (see code example for indentation standard).

1. Add a form with a select box and a button for submitting the form.
2. The application shall use a **form / response page** (**not** a self referencing form)
3. A select box should contain a list of the countries in the array.
5. Make a table containing the vehicles with a **row layout** .
6. Add filtering to the table so that only the vehicles from the country selected in the dropdown are shown.
4. If a search term has been given, the search term from the dropdown should be shown in a div above the table.
7. When nothing has been selected in the dropdown **ALL** vehicles should be shown.
8. Update the styling (use inline or css in head element, no external css files are allowed) to make the table look distinct from the previous table e.g. change colors/background colors/fonts etc.
9. No further styling is necessary, the default browser styling is sufficient.

### Report Requirements
