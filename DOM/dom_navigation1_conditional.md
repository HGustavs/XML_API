# Overview
This example shows how we can produce conditional stying in a simple application that uses the DOM.

# Initiation
All DOM code uses the same architecture. The initiation is described in the Initiation example.

# Dom Document / Querying
We can perform conditional styling in the exact same way that we perform conditional styling in SAX, by using an if-statement.
