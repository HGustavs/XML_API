# Overview
This example shows how we can write links and read that link in our application

# Initiation
All DOM code uses the same architecture. The initiation is described in the Initiation example.

# Dom Document / Querying
The aim is to write an <a> element with a href that links to a php file, while passing the data as a parameter.
	
Reading the data from the link is done with $_GET instead of $_POST for the common html form.
