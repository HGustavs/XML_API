# Description
PHP requires a web server to run, i.e., you cannot load a file with PHP code directly in your browser. 

The highlighted rows in the source code are PHP code and is executed by the web server and the result is sent back to the browser. In this case it writes the text "Hello!" to the web page.

Any code that is not inside PHP tags) is copied verbatim (i.e. character for character) by the browser.
~~~
<? php
// Above is the PHP start tag
// Below is the PHP end tag
?>
~~~

The echo command writes some text to the web page. This text can either be normal text or html code.

The resulting page thus contains the html code above and below the PHP code and the text "Hello!" is generated by the web server when executing the php code between the PHP start tag and PHP end tag..

The PHP code can be seen in the preview window top left, and a running preview can be seen to the bottom right window.
